<h1 id="main-metrics">Main metrics</h1>
<ul>
<li><u><strong>Quality Gate Status</strong></u> : State of the quality gate associated to the project. Possible values: ERROR, WARN, OK. It changes after each scan. </li>
<li><u><strong>Reliability</strong></u> : Number of bugs, number of new bugs, etc... Reliability rating: A = 0 bug, B = at least <strong>1 Minor</strong> bug,
 C = at least 1 <strong>Major</strong> bug, D = at least <strong>1 critical</strong> bug, E = at least <strong>1 Blocker</strong> bug</li>
<li><u><strong>Security</strong></u> : Number of vulnerabilities, number of new vulnerabilities, etc... Reliability rating same as Reliability rating</li>
<li><u><strong>Complexity</strong></u> Cyclomatic complexity is used up to version 6.3. 
It&#39;s measured on choices and branches i.e. numbers of if, else, while, switch/case
It is recommended to have at least a cyclomatic complexity of 12 in a method. Each method add 1 to the complexity.</li>

<pre><code>String getMonth (int monthNumber) {//+1
   switch (monthNumber) {
    case 1:                        //+1
       return &quot;January&quot;;
    case 2:                       //+1
       return &quot;February&quot;;
    default:
    return &quot;Error&quot;;
  }
}
</code></pre><ul>
<li><u><strong>Metric</strong></u> : Number of classes, files, lines, lines of code,methods, projects, statements ....</li>
<li><u><strong>Duplications</strong></u> : duplicated blocks, files, lines</li>
<li><u><strong>Maintainability</strong></u> : Number of code smells, technical debt i.e effort to fix all maintainability issues.</li>
<li><u><strong>Tests</strong></u> : Condition coverage, line coverage, etc...</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>Condition coverage = (conditions evaluated to true at least once + conditions evaluated to false at least once ) / (2* total number of conditions)
boolean a = false;
boolean b = true;
boolean c = false;

if(a &amp;&amp; (b || c) ){ ...}

Condition coverage =  (2 + 1) / (2*3) = 0.5
