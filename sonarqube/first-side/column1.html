<p> SonarQube version: <strong>6.3+</strong> - Date: <strong>February 2018</strong></p>
<h1 id="main-concepts">Main concepts</h1>
<p><u><strong>Quality Gates</strong></u> : Set of boolean conditions based on measure thresholds 
<strong>against which projects are measured during a period</strong>. </p>
<pre><code>Blocker Issues equals 0
Code Coverage is greater than 80%
</code></pre><p><u><strong>Rules</strong></u>: rules are executed on source to generate issues. Three basic types of rules: <strong>Reliability</strong>, <strong>Maintainability</strong> and <strong>Security</strong>
Rule definition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Language</li>
<li>Type: bug, vulnerability, code smell</li>
<li>Tag</li>
<li>Repository</li>
<li>Status: beta, deprecated, ready</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;.equals()&quot; should not be used to test the values of &quot;Atomic&quot; classes
Language: Java
Type: bug
Tag: multi-threading
Repository: N/A
Status: ready
</code></pre><p><u><strong>Quality profiles</strong></u> : Collections of rules to apply during an analysis.
Each language has a default profile</p>
<p><u><strong>Leak period</strong></u> :  period (generally last release) in which newly added code is analysed against specified criteria.</p>
<p><u><strong>Metric</strong></u> : A type of measurement. Examples: number of lines of code, number of duplicated blocks, complexity etc.</p>
<p><u><strong>Reliability</strong></u> : code that can produce operational risks or unexpected behavior at runtime. Must of time it&#39;s the consequence of lack of compliance with best practice </p>
